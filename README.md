# INPUT magazine articles extractor

This is a Python script that uses `qpdf` to build PDF collections of articles in a given series. See scanInput.py for more details.

You'll need to install qpdf (e.g. `brew install qpdf`).

There is also a script that can generate pngs showing where in the publish run of input articles of a certain type appeared (visualiseInput.py).
You'll have to install pillow first (`pip install pillow`).
