# INPUT magazine articles extractor

This is a Python script that uses `qpdf` to build PDF collections of articles in a given series. See scanInput.py for more details.

You'll need to install qpdf (e.g. `brew install qpdf`).

There is also a script that can generate pngs showing where in the publish run of input articles of a certain type appeared (visualiseInput.py).
You'll have to install pillow first (`pip install pillow`).

# Stats on input

See `Input magazine content tagging.csv`.

# INPUT magazine minutiae

The peripheral series is not numbered!
did they take solicitations? See note at bottom of yellow index pages
Cliffhanger – they published the entire binary content of memory to check it – rather than checksums! Not even a checksum byte per page.
P article in issue 50 has no name.
machine code article – claims mc is nice and easy,  not like HLLs!
mc sprite routines were using &FFEE usual printing routine – kind of pointless?
